piranhas
========

A simulation game in which piranhas driven by different AI implementations compete against each other and try to survive by eating foot or other piranhas.

Piranhas was a project of 5 students that was done as part of a programming class at the University of Applied Scieneces Augsburg.

Concept
-------

Piranhas live in a rectangular sea which is devided into equal-sized squares. Each piranha can use a different AI implementation to think about his moves. To survive he has to find food (feet of careless swimmers or other piranhas)
otherwise he would starve to death.

Piranhas has a client-server architecture which allows different clients driven by different AIs to compete on one server.
